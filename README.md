# Treehouse-Website-Optimization
Web site performance is often a live-or-die metric for web sites and apps. Sites and apps that load, or appear to load, quickly are usually seen as being better built and more useful. Also, taking people's available bandwidth, especially on mobile devices, into account makes people happier about using your site or app.  Apply the skills you've learned for optimization of graphics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take a poorly optimized page and reduce the total load size to under 1.3MB. You will need to analyze the assets you've been provided to see where optimizations can and need to be made, make those optimizations, and measure their success. Multiple analyzation, optimization, and measuring cycles may be required.
